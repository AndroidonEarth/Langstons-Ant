To replicate the "highway" phenomenon illustrated in the Langston's Ant wikipedia, select at least a 100 x 100 board with at least 11000 moves, then after the first step is executed select option 2 to execute every calculation step in the program and display the final result. For Windows, if your console screen is not large enough, right click the top of the window, click properties, and under 'layout' increase the size of your window.
